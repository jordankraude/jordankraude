- My goal is to build clean, efficient, and user-friendly designs, with a focus on continuous learning and improvement.
- Ask me about anything related to web development, UI/UX design, or graphic design!

## Projects and Experience
Some cool past projects that I have worked on include: 
- A Recipe Finder and Storage page. [Found Here](https://whats-cooking-5ewg8y6ac-jordan-kraudes-projects.vercel.app/)
- A personal web arcade. [Found Here](https://main--genuine-sherbet-ba1f4d.netlify.app/gamepage/index.html?category=game)
- An easy to find and download photo page (without all of the hassle of signing up or creating a profile). [Found Here](https://nit-pic-jordankraude-jordan-kraudes-projects.vercel.app/)
- A personal learning management system (almost like a not as good google drive). [Found Here](https://plums-two.vercel.app/)
- An inventory management page (though there is no actual page up). 
- A backend to serve a fictional library. [Found Here](https://libraryserve.onrender.com/)
- A starter webpage for a ficticious startup web design company. [Found Here](https://webdev-frontend-lt6r.vercel.app/)

All of these can be found on my portfolio page below in the website projects area.

Some of the projects that I look to start/finish here in this next year include: 
- A Donate Page to familiarize myself with online transaction softwares such as stripe (also so I could hopefully make some money (: )
- An Ethical Web Scrapper
- A lot of actual TBD hard coding projects to help refresh myself in using C# and python.
